# Cine Insight

## Introduction

Francis Ford Coppola said one day...

> _Art depends on luck and talent._

But seriously, when we make a movie, we cannot ignore the factor of actors and the genres. _MOVIE MAKERS WANT TO MAKE MONEY, of course..._

Cine Insight provides you more _insights_ to make a good movie, so that the talent is no more mandatory!
